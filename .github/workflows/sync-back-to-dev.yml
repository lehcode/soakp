# The section is needed to drop the default write-all permissions for all jobs
# that are granted on `push` event. By specifying any permission explicitly
# all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised
# workflow can do (because of an injection or compromised third party tool or
# action) is restricted. Adding labels to issues, commenting
# on pull-requests, etc. may need additional permissions:
