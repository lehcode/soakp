# Certbot service



**Certbot works only for live domains.** You cannot generate certificates for `localhost` with it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lehcode/soakp.git
$ cd soakp
```



# $ docker compose up certbot
$ node -r ts-node/register server.ts
```

Use any service to make your machine's port SERVER_PORT (in .env) available externally if you use this approach.
Once started, server is available at `https://[your-domain]:3033` with a completely valid SSL certificate. You need to specify `localhost` as `CB_DOMAIN` and leave empty `CB_WILDCARD_DOMAIN`

Consider configuring your domain's DNS servers prior to starting Certbot.
Remember that changes in domain DNS may need some time to propagate over the internet nameservers.
Usually, this is 24-48 hours but often happens faster.

## Usage

1. Create `/usr/local/var/certbot` directory, it will keep certificates once they are generated by Certbot.
