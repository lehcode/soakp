# Deployment Options

The library provides a number of deployment options, including AWS Lambda using serverless for a super-quick deployment of your secured server instance. It also supports a range of cloud DNS providers, including _Route53_, _Ovh_, _Cloudflare_, [_DigitalOcean_](https://bit.ly/434c5IW), _Google_, _DNSimple_, [_Linode_](https://bit.ly/ghlinode), and others.

Build and deploy the server script somewhere. It can be cloud hosting or any local machine. Use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

SOAKP can also be run using `ts-node` environment without generation of JS files. Please refer to the `ts-node` [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) on how to do that.
